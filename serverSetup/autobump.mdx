<Note>When the auto bump feature is enabled, you will not be able to manually bump your server. Please ensure you want to rely on automated bumps before activating this feature.</Note>

## Setting Up Auto Bump

Follow these steps to enable or disable the auto bump feature for your server:

1. Use the `/autobump setup` command to toggle the auto bump feature on or off.
2. Confirm your choice, and the bot will either start or stop automatically sharing your server.
3. Monitor the activity to ensure your server remains visible and effectively engages new members.

Enabling auto bump helps maintain consistent visibility for your server without requiring manual action, simplifying community growth.
