## Setting Up the Banner

Follow these steps to set up the banner for your server:

1. Use the `/banner setup` command to upload a banner image.
2. Select or upload an image that fits your server's branding and aesthetic.
3. Ensure the image is high-quality and appropriate, as it will be the face of your server when promoting it to others.
4. The banner will be displayed in bumps and help attract more members to your server.

A good banner enhances your server's appearance and can significantly boost member engagement and growth.
