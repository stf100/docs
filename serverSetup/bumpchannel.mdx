<Note>
Ensure the bot has access to a visible bump channel, or you risk being banned from the BumpIt! bot. Bumping requires both sending and receiving bumps to be effective. The following permissions are necessary for the bot to function properly:

- View Channel
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
</Note>

## Setting Up the Bump Channel

To ensure smooth operation and maximum visibility for your server, set up a dedicated bump channel. Follow these steps:

1. Create a channel or select an existing one for the bot to post bumps.
2. Use `/channel setup` to configure the bot for this channel.
3. Verify that the bot has the required permissions (View Channel, Send Messages, Embed Links) to operate correctly.
4. Your server will now be ready to share bumps and gain visibility in other servers!
