<Note>Ensure that you use valid hex codes (e.g., `#FF5733`) when setting a custom color for your server's embed. Other formats may not be accepted.</Note>

## Setting Up the Color

Follow these steps to set a custom color for your server's embed:

1. Use the `/color setup` command to begin setting the color.
2. Enter a valid hex code for the desired color. For example, use `#FFFFFF` for white or `#000000` for black.
3. The chosen color will be applied to the server embed, adding a unique visual style to your bump messages.
4. Ensure the color complements your server's branding to make it visually appealing to potential new members.

Custom colors give your server embed a distinctive look and help it stand out when shared with other servers.
