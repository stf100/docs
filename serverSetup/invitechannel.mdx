### Common Issues with Invite Links

Here are some common issues you might encounter when setting up invite links:

- **Invite Link Not Working:** Ensure the bot has the **Create Instant Invite** permission in the selected channel. Also, verify the invite hasn't expired.
  
- **Invite Link Leads to the Wrong Channel:** Double-check that you selected the correct channel when setting up the invite link. Make sure it’s a channel that’s visible and welcoming for new members.

- **Invite Link Expires Too Soon:** If the invite link expires quickly, set the invite duration to last longer, or create a permanent link to avoid frequent resets.
