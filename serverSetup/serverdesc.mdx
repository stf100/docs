## Setting up the server description

To begin, invite WeBump to your server.

Once invited, follow these steps to set up your server description:

1. Use the `/description setup` command.
2. Enter a clear and concise description that best represents your community.
3. Ensure that the description follows community guidelines, as inappropriate language will be automatically filtered.
4. After setting up, this description will be used to promote your server when the bot sends your bumps.

This description helps other communities understand your serverâ€™s focus, so make it engaging and relevant!
